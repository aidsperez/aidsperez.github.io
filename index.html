                            <p>A phishing website is a websites that is smilar in appearance with its corresponding 
                                legitiate website to deceive users into believing that they are browsing the correct website. 
                                These phishing websites can take some time to verify manually and may cause financial and reputational impact to the target 
                                organizations. Thus in this project, several machine several machine learning classification 
                                algorithms were trained using the publicly available phishing data from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Phishing+Websites">
                                UCI archive</a> to see which model will be best suited to use for phishing 
                                website detector. Out of the 8 models used, Random Forest produced the highest test accuracy, 
                                which is 0.97. Feature importance also shows that secure connection or presence of SSL certificate 
                                and unusual hyperlinks embedded in the web page are two of the top predictors. A feature selection was 
                                also performed and the result showed that with 8 less features in the dataset, the Random Forest 
                                classifier still produced almost the same accuracy.</p>

                            <p>With the impact of these machines, there lies their vulnerability from malicious entities that has taken advantage to unsecured computers through the network on which they are connected. In this study, we explore the nature of network attacks under the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SSH protocols through the collective behavior of each network traffic's flags using exploratory data analysis. This helped us discover that network attacks (e.g. DOS, DDOS, etc) can be differentiated even by observing the nature of the flag packets for every traffic. In extension to this findings, we have concluded that with the use of RandomForest or Decision Trees we can predict the status of our networks at 75.40% accuracy. We recommend that future researchers should explore the possiblity of creating prediction models which uses other features other than those flag packets that were used in this study. With such, we could discover a much comprehensive association with network attacks and other network traffic parameters.</p>

                            <p>As long as there are computer geeks out there with malicious intents, different types of malwares and other hacking techniques will always be on the loose to either harm certain individual or serve one's own interest. A thorough analysis of a malware is a difficult task, which only skilled individuals can do. The challenge now is how to disseminate these findings to the whole information security community in a way that people can quickly acquire the critical information they need about these malwares and other hacking incident to prepare them and be one step ahead of the people with malicious intents. This project aims to improve the classification model for malware-related sentences as part of the ongoing initiative of creating a global database of malware reports. The model developed is a Convolusional Neural Network (CNN) which has an accuracy of 89%. This is significantly higher that what is presented in the first implementation which only has 50% accuracy. However, a direct comparison cannot be made since the two studies used different sets of data.</p>

                            <p>Emotion plays an influential role in the field of journalism. Depending on the selection of facts and arguments, the representation of truth is bent towards an emotion. Thus, delivering emotionally driven news while sustaining ethical, social, and economic values of journalism is a huge challenge to the media. Emotions like happiness, fear, anger, hatred, and love are derived from one's mood, relationships, or circumstances. These emotions are expressed through numerous channels like body language, voice, facial expressions, and written messages. As emotions are subjective, complex experiences, several challenges were identified to recognize emotional labels from these channels. In the case of text data, extracting emotions from these creates highly sparse data with many dimensions. In this paper, we employ ensemble classification techniques from machine learning to recognize the emotion distribution from news articles. We leverage the crowd annotated mood metrics from Rappler as our target feature for the machine learning models. Using 17548 articles from Rappler, we used eight separate machine learning models, one for each mood type, to train and test the models. The resulting models outperformed the F1 score using Dummy Classifier, which serves as the baseline. These results offer a simple way for news agencies, marketers, and corporates to recognize reader-perspective emotion distribution from the text. Also, the results can generate an emotion vector using classifier models to measure the relative strengths of emotions that can surpass benchmark measures. Furthermore, this study can be improved by using advanced natural language processing methods and deep learning models.</p>

                            <p>Since the COVID-19 breakdown in Wuhan last November 2019, the majority of the countries experienced economic losses. The virus has claimed a hundred thousands of lives and contracted by millions of people. To prevent the spreading of the virus in the Philippines, the government imposed the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon on March 16, 2020. Despite this, the still virus spreads in the country, claiming lives, shutting down businesses, and hampering human activities that need transportation. Critical issues arise as a result of the pandemic. The study aims to answer if the government is focused on addressing these critical issues. The dataset comes from the transcripts from the Presidential Communications Operation Office(PCOO). These transcripts were extracted, and clean before preprocessing using text data vectorization. Dimensionality reduction through truncated SVD is used on the preprocessed data. To extract the topics, representative based and agglomerative clustering methods are implemented. This study led to the following conclusions: 1) In the context of Pres. Duterte's weekly program, the government continues to discuss critical issues related to the pandemic; and 2) Using clustering analysis, topics for plans, strategies, and challenges related to the pandemic were identified. These topics include healthcare system challenges, vaccines, and corruption during the implementation of the social amelioration program.</p>

                            <p>This study intends to determine, through data science techniques in natural language processing, 
                                if significant changes can be detected in the manner that articles were written before and after 
                                the ABS-CBN shutdown in the Philippines in the year 2020. The significance of this study is to 
                                determine if data science can detect if censorship or pressure from the state or other strong 
                                political forces can influence the way news is written and published. Articles before and after 
                                the shutdown from two primary news sources (i.e., ABS-CBN and GMA News) were chosen, ranging from 
                                three months before to three months after the actual date of the shutdown itself.  Preprocessing 
                                and cleaning were carried out in order to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  
                                Results were compared across the two timeframes and across the two sources. Notable shifts in 
                                the dominant topics discussed by each source were detected for both timeframes, with topics 
                                disappearing and emerging after the shutdown.  Furthermore, shifts in sentiment scores were also 
                                detected across both sources with evident changes in polarity for some uncovered topics.  Major 
                                topics and sentiment compound scores were presented as a result of the algorithms used.</p>

                            <p>Cryptocurrency, bitcoin in particular, has sparked the journey of decentralized payment system using blockchain technology. Today, big eCommerce companies has already adapted accepting bitcoins as mode of payment for some of their products. While some traders and investors may see this as the currency of the future, others are still skeptic and intrigued with this cryptocurrency, primarily because of its extremely volatile behavior. As such, can we use Big Data and machine learning to effectively forecast bitcoin prices? In this project, the we aim to answer this problem by estimating bitcoin price based on the daily global news and events from GDELT and Bitcoin trading information. A total of 2.5TB of raw GDELT data was collected, which was reduced to 148GB after filtering. This data was then preprocessed to extract the average daily tone components of the global events. These features were included for the model training. The forecasting setup was done for a 1-day, 3-days, and 7-days ahead from our present information. The team found that using Gradient Boosting Regressor is the best model with an MAE of 179.04. This surpassed the baseline MAE produced by ARIMA, which is at 193.06. On the other hand, XGBoost Regressor was the best predictor for the 3-days and 7-days forecast. It was found that our models get less accurate when our predictions get further into the future we may account this behavior to the reducing significance of a news article as time progresses. Lastly, the news structure (e.g. activity and self/group reference density) are found to be the most important sentiments from our news data.</p>

                                type. The less dominant Cluster 0 (40% of considered listings) is composed of family-sized units with 
                                higher mean price and stricter cancellation policy, while Cluster 1 (60% of considered listings) is 
                                composed of more financially-friendly private rooms with more flexible cancellation policies. Results 
                                convey a potential capacity gap in sustaining local travels of family-sized groups. Meanwhile, solo travels 
                                are not affeted due to an abundance of private rooms in the city. This provides solo travellers to have a 
                                place that is private while maintaining socila distancing guidelines. Lastly, the group discovered that only a 
                                small percentage of listings (shared rooms - 3%) is strongly affected by the pandemic. </p>

                            <p>The slow pandemic response in the Philippines catapulted several data-driven initiatives from citizens and research institutes. Some of these include a hospital bed availability visualization, a vaccination rollout tracker, and a Frequently Ask Questions chatbot. However, COVID-19-related data in the country remain to be siloed and scattered. The existing data repository managed by Thinking Machines and the Department of Health only track the number of cases and hospital beds per day and do not aggregate data from other sources like social media. To groups to conduct more data driven research related to COVID-19, we developed a Data Lake using AWS S3, Redshift and DynamoDB. We believe that we can better harness the available data from DOH and other sources if there is an available publicly maintained data repository/ pipeline that will aggregate this information. It is recommended that the proposed data pipeline be improved by providing an API access that could customize the access of data and its dashboard for the local government. In addition, integration of additional “dark” data is essential to provide a better picture to stakeholders regarding the effect of their enforced policies and present situation of the communities.</p>

                            <p>One of the main challenges of forensic investigators is SSD’s file recovery of deleted items. 
                                Because of SSD’s way of deleting files in most modern computers, it is more challenging now and
                                 almost impossible to recover files once they are deleted. As computer forensic investigators, 
                                 it is vital to communicate these details to manage the client’s expectations.</p>

                            <p>A Sudoku Solver was created by using Image Processing Techniques, CNN Digit Image Classifier
                                and a Sudoku Solver Program. The Sudoku Solver was able to output a solution to the input
                                Sudoku image as long as the CNN is able to correctly identify the digits on the input image.</p>
